# 📁 R36S File Manager

### 🧠 About the Project

This is a tiny file manager made for the R36S — that handheld console that was meant just for gaming but somehow became my personal coding lab of chaos.

The idea was simple: I wanted to *relearn how to code*, and apparently the best way to do that is by recreating something that already exists a thousand times — just with my own customized bugs.

### ⚙️ What It Does (Or Tries To)

* Manages files.
* Moves, copies, and deletes stuff (with the constant fear of deleting everything).
* Built in the spirit of “works on my machine.”
* And yes, it MAY run on the R36S someday - but today is not the day.

### 🧩 Why It Exists

Because studying is hard, but breaking systems is fun.
This project started as a technical excuse to open my code editor without admitting that I’m rewatching 2018 tutorials.

---

### 💡 Philosophy

> “Don’t just play games — break their file system.”

Learn by playing, study by breaking, and laugh when everything just goes wild.

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack

Depends on my mood. For now:

* Bash.
* Coffee.
* And a pinch of stubbornness.

---

### 🚧 Current Status

Currently switching between:

* “It works!”
* “I have no idea what happened.”
* “But it worked yesterday...”

---

### 🕹️ Contributions

Wanna help? Good luck.
PRs, feedback, and reminders on how to code properly are all welcome.

---

### 📜 License

MIT — because if it breaks, it’s not my fault.

---

### 🤘 The Moral of the Story

A small project, yes.
But just enough to make me start studying again — and remember why I stopped in the first place.
